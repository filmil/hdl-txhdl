// The Vreteno board on the Alinx AX7A200: the pin and clock wrapper
// around the lowered design, and nothing else.
//
// Everything that computes is `board`, the netlist `#[lower]` writes for
// `vreteno32::board::Board`: the core, the router, the data memory, the
// timer, the serial port and the DDR3 memory with UberDDR3's controller
// in it. What a board needs and a lowered unit cannot say is here: the
// 200 MHz differential clock turned into the four clocks the design and
// the controller run on, the resets, and the LEDs.
//
// The clocks come from one PLL, as the a200t examples make them: the
// 200 MHz input times six is 1200 MHz, which gives 100 MHz for the
// design and the controller, 400 MHz for the memory, the same 400 MHz a
// quarter cycle late, and 200 MHz for the controller's delay control.
//
// The memory's reset follows the button and the PLL's lock. The core's
// reset follows those and the controller's calibration as well, so the
// core starts only when the memory it may reach is ready. Both are
// brought into the design's clock by two flip-flops.
//
// The LEDs are lit when driven low: the core halted, the serial line
// driven at least once, the memory calibrated, and a heartbeat.
//
// The second LED carries what the heartbeat used to, and the heartbeat
// moved to the fourth. The second now latches the first start bit on the
// serial line, which is the open question of issue #195: the board halts
// with every LED on and nothing arrives on the host's serial port, and
// nothing so far says whether a byte ever left the core.
//
// The fourth LED showed the PLL's lock. A blinking heartbeat says that
// as well, since the counter behind it runs on the PLL's output, and a
// heartbeat in a new place is also how somebody at the board can tell
// that a new bitstream is in the part.

  //
  // The button resets the core and not the memory. The memory's reset
  // follows the PLL's lock alone, which is power-on. A reset that
  // reached the controller while a transaction was in flight stranded
  // the bus: the bridge in front of the controller waited on an
  // acknowledgement the reset controller never gave, nothing resets
  // that bridge, and every later access to the memory queued behind
  // it, so the loader took three words after a press and then nothing
  // (issue #333). With the memory running through the press, what was
  // in flight completes while the core is held, the core drains the
  // answers as it always does, and the bus is clean when it restarts.
  // The memory's contents survive a press, which is what a warm reset
  // means.
  //
  // The serial line held low resets the core as well: low for far
  // longer than any byte, 20 ms against a byte's 87 us, which no
  // program on the core produces and the host makes by sending one
  // zero byte at 300 baud, 30 ms of low. Not a break: a break through
  // this board's CP2102N, as Linux drives it, never reached the pin. It
  // gives the host a reset that no software on the core can miss,
  // because it is not software on the core, and it is what
  // `load --reset` uses (issue #332). The line is brought into the
  // design's clock through two flip-flops first. The reset is a pulse
  // when the count reaches the threshold rather than a level while the
  // line is low, so a line left floating low resets the core once and
  // not forever. The pulse is a millisecond, not a few cycles: a fetch
  // from the memory caught in flight answers long after a short pulse
  // has ended, and the core, back in the loader by then, would take
  // that answer as the reply to its first read of the serial port. A
  // finger on the button holds the reset for a tenth of a second and
  // never sees this; the break's reset has to be held on purpose.
